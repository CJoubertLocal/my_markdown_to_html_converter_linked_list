# Introduction

## A Small File

This is a *small* file. It contains - neigh - requires the program to correctly translate a variety of different Obsidian Markdown elements into the HTML elements I want.

For example, paragraphs[^1], that "0 < 1" and "2 > 1", **and** ***headings***. `Code blocks`, such as the below should also be interpreted correctly.

```Pseudocode
fn removeCharacterFromList(remList list, charToRemove char) list {
    match remList {
        case x::[]:
            match x {
                charToRemove: []
                _: x
            }
        case x::xs:
            match x {
                charToRemove: removeCharacterFromList(xs, charToRemove)
                _: x::removeCharacterFromList(xs, charToRemove)
            }
    }
}

removeCharacterFromList(['a', 'b', 'c'], 'a')
```[^2]
